### Custom integrations

This document provides a simple OpenAPI specification for the minimum API requirements needed to connect your data systems with Aide. We maintain flexibility regarding the fields returned in responses, requiring only a server endpoint with a URL and API token that implements three core endpoints: listing latest orders, retrieving individual order details, and fetching customer information.
