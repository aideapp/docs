Aide's AI agent works behind the scenes to automatically handle customer conversations and perform actions based on your configured Scenarios. The AI agent can respond to customers using generative AI and automate various help desk and business operations.

## How the AI agent works

The AI agent operates through **Scenarios** - combinations of conditions and actions that determine when and how the AI should respond. When a message is received, Aide evaluates whether it matches your scenario conditions, and if so, executes the configured actions.

The AI agent relies on several sources of knowledge to create accurate responses:

- **Knowledge articles** - imported help center content, manually added articles, and scraped website data
- **Macros and templates** - automatically imported from your help desk platform
- **Product information** - automatically synced from your eCommerce platform
- **AI instructions** - custom prompts and guidelines defined in your Scenarios

## AI agent actions

When using Aide as an AI agent, the following actions are available in Scenarios:

### AI Reply

The **AI reply** action allows you to automatically send responses composed with generative AI. Responses are created based on your knowledge base, macros, and can be guided by AI instructions.

**Safety features:** Aide requires configuring scenarios with specific conditions to ensure the AI only responds when appropriate. This prevents the AI from sending responses to unexpected messages.

**Response verification:** By default, Aide verifies that generated responses fully address customer questions before sending them. If verification fails, the conversation is escalated to a human agent.

The options for escalation are as follows:

- **Escalate with internal comment:** Aide will not send a reply to the customer and will only post an internal comment describing why it did not respond.
- **Escalate with hand-off message:** Aide will send a reply to the customer informing them that a member of the support team will get back to them.

## Escalation handling

When the AI agent cannot create a meaningful response or encounters issues, it escalates to human agents using one of two methods:

- **Escalate with internal comment** - No customer response is sent; only an internal comment explains why the AI didn't respond
- **Escalate with hand-off message** - A customer-facing message informs them that a support team member will follow up

### Run Automation

Aide's AI agent can automatically execute predefined actions, such as:

- **eCommerce actions** - putting orders on hold, updating shipping addresses, canceling orders
- **Help desk actions** - applying tags, changing ticket status, assigning conversations
- **CRM actions** - updating contact information, creating records

### Send Canned Response

Send predefined responses verbatim, with support for Liquid Markup to dynamically insert customer and order data.

### Apply Macro

Automatically execute help desk macros (Zendesk/Front) or templates to perform actions like tagging, assigning, or changing ticket properties.

### Other Actions

- **Post internal comment** - Add internal notes for your team
- **Collect field** - Automatically extract and save specific information from messages
- **AI instructions** - Provide custom guidance for the AI when composing responses

## Enhanced safety and control

AI agent actions are only executed when all scenario conditions are met, ensuring predictable behavior. For regulated industries or situations requiring high accuracy:

1. **Use Topics and Scenarios** instead of relying solely on past responses and knowledge
2. **Define specific conditions** that must be true before actions are taken
3. **Test scenarios** using the [Simulator](https://my.aide.app/simulator) to verify AI behavior

This deterministic approach helps prevent AI hallucinations and ensures the agent only acts when explicitly configured to do so.

## Getting started

To set up your AI agent:

1. **Configure Topics** to categorize incoming messages
2. **Create Scenarios** with conditions and AI agent actions
3. **Import Knowledge** from your help center and add custom articles
4. **Test scenarios** using the simulator before going live

**Tip:** Start with simple scenarios and gradually add complexity. Use the simulator to test how your AI agent will respond before deploying to production.
