title: "AI Agent"
description: "Respond to customers and perform common actions"

Aide's AI agent uses past responses, macros or response templates (which are automatically imported from your help desk once it is connected), and Knowledge in Aide, which that includes any imported help center or documentation that was imported or added manually, including content from your website, and last but not least, "AI instructions" from Scenarios configured in Aide.

In other words, out of the box, Aide's AI agent relies on past responses, macros or response templates, and knowledge (imported help center aticles.) In addition, if you use an eCommerce platform, your products including their descriptions, pricing, and stock availability are also automatically known to Aide.

Do note however, that the AI instructions for the agent are not global, but are only used when the Scenario is found to match.

1. Reply to customers with generative AI and auto-escalate when necessary.
2. Automate help desk actions - like tagging, assigning, or setting ticket statuses and priority.
3. Automate eCommerce or CRM actions - like putting orders on hold, updating addresses, or other custom actions.

#Generating responses

Aide's AI agent is able to reply to customers using generative AI, but only when it is confident that the answers are correct. This is accomplished using the "AI reply" action. To ensure customers always receive meaningful responses, Aide verifies that the response fully addresses the customers question before sending a response. And when it finds that the response is not helpful, it escalates to a member of your team by posting an internal comment and optionally letting the customer know.

The options for escalation are as follows:

- **Escalate with internal comment:** Aide will not send a reply to the customer and will only post an internal comment describing why it did not respond.
- **Escalate with hand-off message:** Aide will send a reply to the customer informing them that a member of the support team will get back to them.

- Learns from previous responses and macros - to reduce setup time.
- Built-in verification for safety â€” Aide verifies that a given answer fully addresses the customer's question. If verification fails, then it is escalated.
- Easily import your existing help center or add articles manually.

# Enhanced Safety

AI agent actions are defined using Scenarios so it's only running on the tickets that matched defined conditions. If you operate in a regulated industry or one where accuracy is paramount, it is recommended to make your system more deterministic and fool-proof using Topics and Scenarios instead of simply relying on past responses, macros, and knowledge articles; Topics and Scenarios rely on a combination of conditions that need to be true before an action is taken (e.g. a response or sent or a tag is applied). This helps ensure that Aide's AI agent only behaves when specified and does not hallucinate.
