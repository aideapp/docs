It is a chat where you can ask Aide questions and see how it would respond. The goal is for you to role-play as a customer as you edit your Aide setup. It is divided into 3 sections:

1. **Conversations list** - list of conversations.
2. **Conversation thread** - this is identical to the conversations page, where once you send a message, Aide detects topic, applies any relevant scenarios, searches across knowledge, and responds accordingly.
3. **Context** - if you use ticket fields or user fields on Zendesk you can enter mock values before starting a simulated conversation to test conditional Scenarios. The simulator can also answer questions about your products if your eCommerce platform is connected to Aide.
