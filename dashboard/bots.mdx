## Customizing your bot

You customize a bot’s description and instructions, chat settings, and add suggested question buttons.

- **Description and instructions** - the description appears under the bot’s name. Instructions are where you can define the bot’s identity, tone, and general behavior.

- **Chat settings** - there are a few settings available, they are as follows:
  - **Team** - you can configure which team the bot belongs to,
  - **Bot identifier** - what it identifies itself as e.g. (bot, agent, pup, etc.)
  - **Greeting messages** - these are the first messages the bots sends to the user when it’s opened.
  - **Contact information** - email address or phone number customer will be directed to if the bot is unable to help.

- **Suggested questions** - are the little pill-like buttons displayed in the bot when the user is interacting with it. These expand to full questions that are then answered by the bot. This is helpful if you want to share frequently asked questions for user to ask the bot.
