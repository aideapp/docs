### Custom integrations

Following is \*\*\*\*simple OpenAPI spec of the minimum API we'd need to connect with your data. We are flexible in terms of the fields returned, we just need a server on your end with a URL and API token we can use, that has 3 endpoints for: listing latest orders, getting an order, getting a customer.
