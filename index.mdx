These docs detail the features offered in the dashboard and how to use them. For more advanced tips and recommendations, reach out to the Aide team for guidance specific to your use-case or industry.

**Aide features that work out the box:**

- **One click integrations**- for popular support and eCommerce, and CRM platforms - Zendesk, Gorgias, Front, Shopify, WooCommerce, and Salesforce, with the ability to easily integrate with custom APIs as needed. See appendix I for more information on integrations.
- **Customer identification** - automatic retrieval of customer information from your CRM or eCommerce platform based on their email, phone number, order ID, or any other unique identifier.
- **Knowledge based drafts** - based on previous conversations, existing macros and canned templates, and your help center, enriched with real customer data from your CRM or eCommerce platform.
- **Topic suggestions** - Aide suggests a set of topics to help you get started. Topics categorize incoming messages for reporting and creating action-based automated scenarios as opposed to relying solely on your help center and response templates.

For use cases where customers want to simply get AI drafts, they can rely on knowledge articles.

For cases where accuracy is paramount and automation pathways and workflows can be defined, a structured approach using topics and scenarios is recommended.
